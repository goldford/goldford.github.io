EM can be applied to MSP in a similar way as in marine conservation except:
- MSP is more complex = models more complex
- Requires extensive “planning to plan”
- Involve people early on in: data collection, shaping and scoping the modeling framework
- Helps to have models ready for “off-the-shelf” use

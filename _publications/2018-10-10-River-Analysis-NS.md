excerpt: 'We present a suite of approaches that can be used to quantify and characterize the cumulative effects of different types of 
riverine barriers. We demonstrate these methods on three river systems in Nova Scotia, Canada, each heavily fragmented by road culverts 
and dams associated with hydroelectric and other development.'

We present a suite of approaches that can be used to quantify and characterize the cumulative effects of different types of riverine barriers. 
We demonstrate these methods on three river systems in Nova Scotia, Canada, each heavily fragmented by road culverts and dams associated with 
hydroelectric and other development.

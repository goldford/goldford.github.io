excerpt: 'Water resources and transportation infrastructure such as dams and culverts provide countless socio-economic benefits; however, this infrastructure
can also disconnect the movement of organisms, sediment, and water through river ecosystems. Trade-offs associated with these
competing costs and benefits occur globally, with applications in barrier addition (e.g. dam and road construction), reengineering (e.g. culvert
repair), and removal (e.g. dam removal and aging infrastructure). Barrier prioritization provides a unique opportunity to: (i) restore and reconnect
potentially large habitat patches quickly and effectively and (ii) avoid impacts prior to occurrence in line with the mitigation hierarchy
(i.e. avoid then minimize then mitigate).'

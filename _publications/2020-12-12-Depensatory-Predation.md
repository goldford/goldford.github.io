permalink: /publication/2020-12-12-Depensatory-Predation
excerpt: 'We showed that including depensatory predation rates caused a fundamental change in the fish population dynamics compared with the traditional approach of ignoring predation scenarios in stock assessments.  Increases in pinniped abundance following a history of heavy exploitation make it progressively more difficult to avoid fish stock collapses, and there is evidence of similar impacts for a variety of small pelagic and demersal stocks around the world.'

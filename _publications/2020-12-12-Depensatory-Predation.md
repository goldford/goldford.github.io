We found a critical herring biomass threshold that can lead to extinction depending on the Steller sea lion functional response. 
We discuss that recent increases in sea lion abundances during the winter herring spawning season in B.C. makes it progressively more difficult to avoid stock collapses.  
Other B.C. stocks like Eulachon may be suffering similar depensatory impacts, and there is evidence of similar impacts for a variety of small pelagic stocks around the world.

River systems present unique challenges when attempting to assess the impacts of barriers and costs/benefits of habitat restoration and connectivity projects, making answering the above questions difficult, time consuming, or both. 
<a href="https://goldford.github.io/FIPEX_with_DCI_Website/">The Fish Passage Extension (FIPEX) with Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI)</a> is designed to help address these challenging questions.
I have been lead developer on this project since 2009.

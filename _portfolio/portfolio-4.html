I worked as a Federal government scientist and planner in collaboration with 17 First Nations, the Provincial Government, industry, NGO's, and stakeholders to plan a network of Marine Protected Areas in Canada's 'Northern Shelf Bioregion'.  
<a href="https://www.mpanetwork.ca"></a>
My role was to help coordinate technical aspects of planning as co-lead of the technical planning committee, listen to and address concerns of collaborating parties, liase with science colleagues and DFO econommists, manage staff and contracts, and play a generally supporting role as marine spatial planning advisor. 
I learned a great deal from this work experience and deeply appreciate the opportunity to work so closely with such a variety of people.

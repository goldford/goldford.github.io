<b>A Network of Marine Protected Areas in the Northern Shelf Bioregion (2013-2018)</b><br/>
I worked as a Canadian Federal Government scientist and planner in collaboration with 17 First Nations, the Provincial Government, industry, NGO's, and stakeholders to plan a network of Marine Protected Areas in Canada's 'Northern Shelf Bioregion'.

I learned a great deal from this work experience and deeply appreciate the opportunity to work so closely with such a variety of people. <br/>
My role was to:<br/>
- help coordinate technical aspects of planning as co-lead of the MPA Technical Team,<br/>
- listen to and address concerns of collaborating parties,<br/>
- liaise with science colleagues and DFO analysts, managers and economists,<br/>
- manage staff and contracts,<br/>
- play a generally supporting role as marine spatial planning advisor.<br/>

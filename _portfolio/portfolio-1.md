Since 2018, I've been pursuing a PhD in ecosystem modelling, quantitative ecology, and oceans science at the University of British Columbia's Institute for Oceans and Fisheries.

The project I'm working on is connected to the Salish Sea Marine Survival Program. I'm investigating hypotheses related to declines in survival of salmon in the Salish Sea, with a focus on the central / north portion (Strait of Georgia).

The <a href="https://twnation.ca/">Tsleil Waututh First Nation</a> is leading a project to reconstruct the pre-European contact shoreline and intertidal zone. I assisted with cartography and integrating indigenous knowledge using GIS and I am a co-author of <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/facultyresearchandpublications/52383/items/1.0407075">the resulting report</a>. There was a nice bit of coverage by the <a href="https://epaper.vancouversun.com/article/281517934590447">Vancouver Sun</a>, too.

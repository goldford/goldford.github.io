I was a teaching assistant for this undergraduate course in 2010 and 2011. I led teaching GIS labs where I prepared tutorials (5-7 per semester), lectured to a lab of 15-30 undergraduate students, assisted students in the computer lab, marked assignments, uploaded grades, and marked the final exams.

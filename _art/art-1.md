I was inspired years ago by a diagram of the Scotian Shelf food web (Atlantic Canada) which I had beside my desk for the better part of a decade. 
I later learned the style of the diagram is colloquially referred to as a 'horrendigram'. 
For my research, I wanted a diagram but feared people would think it would be horrendous! 
So, this illustration is my attempt to depict the most important components and connections - while being visually appealling. 
Subway maps were a main artistic motif that I used as inspiration.

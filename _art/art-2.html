This was my resident scholar project at the Centre for Art Tapes (CFAT), part of the New Media Art Scholarship Program (2013-14). 
A food web model was the inspiration (Lavigne, 1996; drawing by Dean Huyck).

Food web models represent the trophic (feeding) relationships between species and I find the complexity awe-dropping. 
Another inspiration was Mark Cheetham's <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241898316_The_Crystal_Interface_in_Contemporary_Art_Metaphors_of_the_Organic_and_Inorganic">article</a>, <i>"The Crystal Interface in Contemporary Art: Metaphors of the Organic and Inorganic."</i>

I used crystals as a form to connect art and abstract representations of complex ecological relationships.

The result was a hanging sculpture (~4' x 4' x 8') with fibre optics connected to a hidden bank of lights on one end and quartz crystals on the other. 
The lights were controlled to illuminate the crystals in a specific sequence determined by connections beginning from photosynthetic plankton up to top predators.

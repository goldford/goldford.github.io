Nice to meet you. I'm a <b>PhD Candidate</b> at the University of British Columbia in the <b>[Global Ocean Modelling Lab](https://oceans.ubc.ca/villy-christensen/)</b> 
. I am also a scientist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. 

Hailing in from Port Moody, but originally a maritimer, I have spent most of my 10+ years with DFO in the Ecosystem Management Branch (Pacific and Maritimes regions).
In EMB, I chiefly acted as a scientist advising and coordinating scientific and technical aspects of marine spatial planning and conservation planning. 
Much of that has been focused on the [Northern Shelf Bioregion MPA network](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/marine-protected-area-network-partners-endorse-plan-to-protect-british-columbia-s-north-coast-848170307.html). 
As an ecosystem scientist and modeller, I am broadly interested in how we can understand the structure and function of marine and aquatic ecosystems, and how we can develop approaches to wisely manage them.
 While pursing a PhD at UBC's Institute for [Oceans and Fisheries](https://oceans.ubc.ca/) (2018 -), I have been working on simulation models that are end-to-end (i.e., water properties to whales). 
 Focusing on the Salish Sea, I am using a custom framework (NEMO->Ecospace) to investigate factors affecting early marine survival of juvenile salmon. 
 I hope to continue to apply approaches at the regional or sub-regional scale that have mainly been applied to date in global-scale research (e.g., ensemble modelling).
 I am currently applying our modelling framework to investigate the mechanisms through which decadal-scale changes in water properties in the Strait of Georgia may affect plankton communities and juvenile salmon.
 Finally, I have been investigating multispecies interactions between pinnipeds, killer whales, and several fish species. 
I am excited to be joining DFO Science, and learning more about everyone's work!

I have also developed custom tools and models for freshwater ecosystems </b> and <b>ecological restoration</b> of rivers as part 
of my master's degree research. 

I enjoy swimming, cycling, and running (and infrequent triathlons), and [doing creative / artistic things](https://goldford.github.io/art/).
<b>I also am passionate about ethics, equality, and justice</b>, and believe academics hold a privileged position in society 
with [corresponding responsibility](https://chomsky.info/19670223/).

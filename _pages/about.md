Hi!
======
Nice to meet you. I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of British Columbia. I am studying marine ecosystems and use simulation models to investigate scientific questions and support decision making. I like to think I'm a quantitative ecologist and ecosystem modeller but I feel I'm probably better described as an environmental scientist and geographer with a computer programming bent. Previously, I worked as a contractor specializing in custom tools and models for natural resource management and landscape ecology. I spent five years with the Canadian Government as a biologist, physical scientist, and then as a marine spatial planning advisor. What else? I don't have a favorite colour (I don't think it's fair to choose), I am tall and bump my head a lot, and I enjoy cycling, running, and making art. 

Hit me up on the Twitter! @websandflows

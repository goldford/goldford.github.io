Nice to meet you. I'm a <b>PhD Candidate</b> at the University of British Columbia in the <b>[Global Ocean Modelling Lab](https://oceans.ubc.ca/villy-christensen/)</b> and Senior Scientist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. 

At the UBC Institute for Oceans and Fisheries I have been developing spatially resolved end-to-end marine ecosystem simulation models. 
These models support scientific research (hypothesis evaluation) and management or policy.</br>
Here, I have been using a custom oceanographic model using high performance computing resources available in Canada (Compute Canada). I am using the NEMO model framework. 
I have linked this model to an ecosystem model that includes groups from bacteria to whales. For this, I am using the Ecopath-with-Ecosim-and-Ecospace framework.</br>

My fields of research are <b> applied ecosystem science, ocean ecology and management, landscape ecology and structural connectivity of rivers, environmental science, and ecosystem modelling</b>. Technically, I have skillsets in <b>data science, geographic information systems, and [computer programming](https://www.github.com/goldford/)</b>.
Prior to my PhD research, I worked for the Canadian Government (Fisheries & Oceans) as a scientist and as a <b>marine spatial planning</b> advisor in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
Previous to that, I developed custom tools and models for <b>natural resource management</b> and <b>ecological restoration</b> of rivers as part of my master's degree research. 

I enjoy swimming, cycling, and running (and infrequent triathlons), and [doing creative / artistic things](https://goldford.github.io/art/).
<b>I also am passionate about ethics, equality, and justice</b>, and believe academics hold a privileged position in society with [corresponding responsibility](https://chomsky.info/19670223/). 

Hit me up on the Twitter! @greig_oldford

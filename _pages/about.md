Nice to meet you. I'm a <b>PhD Candidate</b> at the University of British Columbia in the <b>[Global Ocean Modelling Lab](https://oceans.ubc.ca/villy-christensen/)</b>. I study marine ecosystems and use computer models to investigate scientific questions and support decision making. 

I am an <b>interdisciplinary environmental scientist and biogeographer</b> with technical specialties in <b>data science, geographic information systems, and computer programming</b>. 
Prior to my PhD research, I worked for the Canadian Government (Fisheries & Oceans) - first as a biologist, then as a physical scientist, and then as a <b>marine spatial planning</b> advisor in Vancouver, British Columbia. Previously, I also developed custom tools and models for <b>natural resource management</b> and <b>ecological restoration</b> of rivers as part of my master's degree research. 

I enjoy swimming, cycling, and running (and infrequent triathlons), and doing creative / artistic things. I have made [short films](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4531223/), written and performed comedy, and had a couple of exhibits in the vein of new media / installation art, and I hope to again someday! 
<b>I also am passionate about ethics, equality, and justice</b>, and believe academics hold a privileged position in society with [corresponding responsibility](https://chomsky.info/19670223/).

Nice to meet you. I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of British Columbia in the [Global Ocean Modelling Lab](https://oceans.ubc.ca/villy-christensen/) . 
I am also a scientist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. 

Hailing in from Port Moody, but originally a maritimer, I have spent most of my 10+ years with DFO in the Ecosystem Management Branch (Pacific and Maritimes regions).
As an ecosystem scientist and modeller, I am broadly interested to better understand the structure and function of marine and aquatic ecosystems, and to develop approaches to wisely manage them.
 In EMB, I chiefly acted as a scientist advising and coordinating scientific and technical aspects of marine spatial planning and conservation planning. 
For example, the [Northern Shelf Bioregion MPA network](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/marine-protected-area-network-partners-endorse-plan-to-protect-british-columbia-s-north-coast-848170307.html). 
While pursing a PhD at UBC's Institute for [Oceans and Fisheries](https://oceans.ubc.ca/) (2018 -), I have been working on simulation models that are end-to-end (i.e., water properties to whales). 
 Focusing on the Salish Sea, I am using a custom framework (NEMO->Ecospace) to investigate factors affecting early marine survival of juvenile salmon. 
 I have also been investigating multispecies interactions between pinnipeds, killer whales, and several fish species. 
 Finally, I hope to apply approaches at the regional or sub-regional scale that have mainly been applied to date in global-scale research (e.g., ensemble modelling).
 I am excited to be joining DFO Science, and learning more about everyone's work!

I have also developed custom tools and models for freshwater ecosystems and ecological restoration of rivers as part 
of my master's degree research.

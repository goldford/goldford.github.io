Hi!
======
Nice to meet you. I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of British Columbia. I am studying marine ecosystems and use simulation models to investigate scientific questions and support decision making. I like to think I'm a quantitative ecologist and ecosystem modeller but I feel I'm probably better described as an environmental scientist and geographer with a computer programming bent. Previously, I worked as a contractor specializing in custom tools and models for natural resource management and landscape ecology. I then spent the better part of a decade with the Canadian Government - first as a biologist, then as a physical scientist, and then as a marine spatial planning advisor. And, I'm probably heading back to work at DFO soon, maybe even by the time you read this (I'm not great at keeping these things up to date). What else? I don't have a favorite colour (I don't think it's fair to choose), I enjoy cycling and running, and doing creative / artistic things. I used to film stuff(https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4531223/) and might again someday!

Hit me up on the Twitter! @websandflows

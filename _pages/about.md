Nice to meet you. I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of British Columbia in the [Global Ocean Modelling Lab](https://oceans.ubc.ca/villy-christensen/) . 
I am also a scientist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. 

Hailing in from Port Moody, but originally a maritimer, I have spent most of my 10+ years with DFO in the Ecosystem Management Branch (Pacific and Maritimes regions).
As an ecosystem scientist and modeller, I am broadly interested in understanding the structure and function of marine and aquatic ecosystems and in approaches to wisely manage them.
 In EMB, I chiefly acted as a scientist advising and coordinating scientific and technical aspects of marine spatial planning and conservation planning. 
For example, the [Northern Shelf Bioregion MPA network](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/marine-protected-area-network-partners-endorse-plan-to-protect-british-columbia-s-north-coast-848170307.html). 
While pursing a PhD at UBC's [Institute for Oceans and Fisheries](https://oceans.ubc.ca/) (2018 -), I have been working on simulation models that are end-to-end (i.e., water properties to whales). 
 Focusing on the Salish Sea, I am using a custom framework (NEMO->Ecospace) to investigate factors affecting early marine survival of juvenile salmon. 
 I have also been investigating multispecies interactions between pinnipeds, killer whales, forage fish, and salmon in the Salish Sea. 
 Finally, I hope to apply approaches at the regional or sub-regional scale that have mainly been applied to date at the global scale (e.g., ensemble modelling) to help improve ecosystem model predictions.
During my masters work and subsequently, I have developed custom tools and models for freshwater ecosystems and ecological restoration of rivers.

Nice to meet you. I'm a <b>PhD Candidate</b> at the University of British Columbia in the <b>[Global Ocean Modelling Lab](https://oceans.ubc.ca/villy-christensen/)</b> 
. I am also a scientist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. 

I am joining DFO Science after spending most of my 10+ years with DFO in the Ecosystem Management Branch. 
There, I chiefly acted as a scientist advising and coordinating scientific and technical aspects of marine spatial planning and conservation planning. 
Much of that has been focused on the Northern Shelf Bioregion MPA network (which was recently endorsed my Canada, BC, and partner First Nations!). 
I have a background in ecology and environmental science, and returned to school in 2018 to pursue a PhD at UBC with the Institute for Oceans and Fisheries. 
As an ecosystem scientist, I am broadly interested in how we can understand the structure and function of marine and aquatic ecosystems, and how we can develop approaches to wisely manage them.
 At UBC, I have been developing spatially resolved end-to-end marine ecosystem simulation models and have developed a custom oceanographic model for the Salish Sea and an ecosystem model for the Strait of Georgia. 
 I am using this framework to investigate factors affecting early marine survival of juvenile Pacific Salmon in support of the Salish Sea Marine Survival Program. 
 Broadly, I motivated to use approaches applied to this point to global scale modelling and analysis (e.g., ensemble modelling) and to apply these approaches at the regional or sub-regional scale.
 I am also investigating the mechanisms through which decadal-scale changes in water properties in the Strait of Georgia are affecting plankton communities and juvenile fish.
 Finally, I have been investigating multispecies interactions between pinnipeds, killer whales, and several fish species. 
I am excited to be joining DFO Science, and learning more about everyone's work!

My fields of research are <b> applied ecosystem science, ocean ecology and management, landscape ecology and structural connectivity of rivers, 
environmental science, and ecosystem modelling</b>. Technically, I have skillsets in <b>data science, geographic information systems, 
and [computer programming](https://www.github.com/goldford/)</b>.
Prior to my PhD research, I worked for the Canadian Government (Fisheries & Oceans) as a scientist and as a <b>marine spatial planning</b> 
advisor in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
Previous to that, I developed custom tools and models for <b>natural resource management</b> and <b>ecological restoration</b> of rivers as part 
of my master's degree research. 

I enjoy swimming, cycling, and running (and infrequent triathlons), and [doing creative / artistic things](https://goldford.github.io/art/).
<b>I also am passionate about ethics, equality, and justice</b>, and believe academics hold a privileged position in society 
with [corresponding responsibility](https://chomsky.info/19670223/).

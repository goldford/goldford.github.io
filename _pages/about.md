Nice to meet you. I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of British Columbia. I am studying marine ecosystems and use simulation models to investigate scientific questions and support decision making. My supervisor is Prof. Villy Christesen who runs the [Global Ocean Modelling Lab](https://oceans.ubc.ca/villy-christensen/). I like to think I'm a quantitative ecologist and ecosystem modeller but I feel I'm probably better described as an environmental scientist and geographer with a computer programming bent. Previously, I worked as a contractor specializing in custom tools and models for natural resource management and landscape ecology. I then spent the better part of a decade with the Canadian Government - first as a biologist, then as a physical scientist, and then as a marine spatial planning advisor. 

What else? I don't have a favorite colour (I don't think it's fair to choose), I enjoy cycling and running, and doing creative / artistic things. I used to make [short films](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4531223/), write and perform comedy, and had a couple of exhibits in the vein of new media / installation art - and I might again someday!

Hit me up on the Twitter! @websandflows

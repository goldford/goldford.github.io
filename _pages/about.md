Nice to meet you. I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of British Columbia in the [Global Ocean Modelling Lab](https://oceans.ubc.ca/villy-christensen/). I study marine ecosystems and use computer models to investigate scientific questions and support decision making. 

I feel I'm best described as an interdisciplinary environmental scientist and biogeographer with technical specialties in data science, geographic information systems, and comptuer programming. Previously, I worked as a contractor specializing in custom tools and models for natural resource management and ecological restoration of rivers. I then spent the better part of a decade with the Canadian Government (Fisheries & Oceans) - first as a biologist, then as a physical scientist, and then as a marine spatial planning advisor. 

I enjoy swimming, cycling, and running (and infrequent triathlons), and doing creative / artistic things. I have madde [short films](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4531223/), written and performed comedy, and had a couple of exhibits in the vein of new media / installation art, and I might again someday! I also am passionate about ethics, equality, and justice, and believe academics hold a priveleged position in society that gives them more power to affect change, with [corresponding responsibility](https://chomsky.info/19670223/). 

Hit me up on the Twitter! @websandflows

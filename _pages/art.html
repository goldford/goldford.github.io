<p>I would probably pursue art full-time if I knew it would pay the bills and I 
would probably choose to prioritise immersive electronic installation art or film. 
I'm always artistically inspired by at least one of two themes: <b>comedy and science.</b> <br></p>
	<p>- <b>What excites me about art and science:</b> the potential to embed scientifically derived knowledge into inspirational art pieces. <br>
	- <b>What excites me about comedy</b>: making people laugh through atypical art / performances. <br></p>
<p>I've written, produced, directed, or acted in several <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4531223/" target="_blank">short films</a>, some of which were accepted and screened at film festivals. 
Here is one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgK3qVfIYfY"  target="_blank">first comedic shorts</a> I did. My collaborators and I were super <i>jazzed</i> to once 
have a <a href="https://youtu.be/mVSMKmgcpjE" target="_blank">weird comedy short</a> written and directed by <a href="https://twitter.com/jandrewgormley" target="_blank">Andrew Gormley</a> be featured by the JASH 
(Sarah Silverman, Michael Cera, Tim and Eric, and Reggie Watts) 'Buh' comedy channel. I've also written and performed comedy, and had a couple of independent exhibits in 
the vein of new media / installation art.<br>
<p>
I'm very grateful to the <a href="https://www.cfat.ca" target="_blank">CFAT New Media Scholarship</a> which afforded me about 
6 months of dedicated focus and a mentor, <a href="https://stephenkelly.ca/?q=node/22" target="_blank">Stephen Kelly</a>. 
This support was instrumental in getting my first public exhibition at the <a href="https://nocturnehalifax.ca/" target="_blank">Nocturne Art at Night Festival</a> and 
a commissioned work for the <a href="https://iceawards.ca/" target="_blank">Atlantic Canada Ice Awards.</a></p>

<p>I think it's important to note that some of what I've done I consider total, embarassing failures. 
To me, that's really ok (it's FINE) - and maybe that's important to share?
I wonder if others also sense a growing culture of projecting (unrealistic) perfection with respect to their work. 
It primarily serves individual careers but ultimately kills creative risk-taking; nothing kills creativity like pressure to never to make mistakes.
And, since you asked, I also suspect that everyone has an artistic drive (i.e. has a need to do <i>autonomous, creative</i> work), 
it's just relatively privileged people like me that are given opportunities to explore that side of themselves.

<p><b>Stay tuned for some Augmented Reality which I'm working on with my friend and long-time collaborator, <a href="http://www.huzzahdesign.ca" target="_blank">Sebastian Harder</a></b></p>
<p>Here are a few of the artsy things I've had time to get up on this site (click on the headings for more details):</p>

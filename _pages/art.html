<p>Upon reflection, I would probably pursue art full-time if it payed the bills - at least until I missed science! I'm a flip-flopper. 
I would probably continue to focus on immersive electronic installation art or film. What I do artistically is inspired by at least one of two themes: <b>comedy and science.</b> <br>
- <b>What excites me about art and science:</b> the potential to embed scientifically derived knowledge in art pieces. <br>
- <b>What excites me about comedy</b>: making people laugh. <br>
I've written, produced, directed, and acted in several <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4531223/">short films</a> that were screened at film festivals. 
My collaborators and I were super <i>jazzed</i> to once have our <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/video/mVSMKmgcpjE/edit">weird comedy shorts</a> be featured by the JASH (Sarah Silverman, Michael Cera, Tim and Eric, and Reggie Watts) 'Buh' comedy channel.  
<br>I've also written and performed comedy, and had a couple of independent exhibits in the vein of new media / installation art - and I hope to again someday! <br>
Some of what I've done has been a complete and utter failure. Some of it I'm very proud of!<br>
<b>Stay tuned for some Augmented Reality which I'm collaborating on with <a href="http://www.huzzahdesign.ca">Sebastian Harder</a></b></p>
